# NWKTreeBuilder

An efficient C++ project for building phylogenetic trees in Newick format.

## It supports:
- [x] build tree from `.nwk` file.
- [x] write tree into `.nwk` file.
- [x] print tree to the shell.
- [x] delete `Node/Clade` in the tree.
- [x] traverse the tree from **root**.
- [ ] traverse from any Node.

## Why create this project?
python's Bio library is unbearably slow, so I use cpp instead.
